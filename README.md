# Document Denoising with Pepper Noise

## Introduction

"Image denoising is a classical yet still active topic in low level vision since it is an indispensable step in many practical applications. The goal of image denoising is to recover a clean image `x` from a noisy observation `y` which follows an image degradation model `y = x + v`. One common assumption is that `v` is additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) with standard deviation `σ`"¹. Another possible assumption is that `v` is pepper noise with probability `p`. For all pixels that are not black, this noise model sets the pixel to black with probability `p`. Such noise may approximate the noise in black-and-white documents.

In the paper "Beyond a Gaussian Denoiser: Residual Learning of Deep CNN for Image Denoising," Kai Zhang, Wangmeng Zuo, Yunjin Chen, Deyu Meng, and Lei Zhang propose the denoising convolutional neural network (DnCNN). "Rather than directly outputing the denoised image `xˆ`, the...DnCNN is designed to predict the residual image `vˆ`, i.e., the difference between the noisy observation and the latent clean image"¹. This model may be trained to remove noise from black-and-white documents by removing the predicted residual image `vˆ` which is assumed to be pepper noise.

For images with pepper noise, a DnCNN may be designed to predict if a black pixel is pepper noise or not for all pixels in the image. Designing a DnCNN to predict if other pixels are pepper noise or not is not necessary because only black pixels may be pepper noise. To design a DnCNN as such, the pepper noise error can be adopted as the loss function to learn the trainable parameters in the DnCNN. The pepper noise loss can be described as...

```
l = w ([y = b] * (v × log(vˆ) + (1 - v) × log(1 - vˆ)))
```

...where `l` is the pepper noise loss, `w` is a manual rescaling weight given to the loss of each batch element, `y` is the noisy observation, `b` is the value for black pixels, `v` is the residual image, `vˆ` is the predicted residual image, and `[y = b]` is the [Iverson bracket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iverson_bracket) of the statement `y = b`. The mean of the pepper noise loss would be `sum(l) / sum([y = b])`. The sum of the pepper noise loss would be `sum(l)`.

## Experimental Results

For pepper noise denoising with unknown probability `p`, 3261 images of various sizes were used for training and 14 images of size 1700 × 2200 were used for validation. The images used for training are from 196 papers from [Denoising | Papers with Code](https://paperswithcode.com/task/denoising). The images used for validation are from the paper "No-Reference Image Quality Assessment in the Spatial Domain" by Anish Mittal, Anush Krishna Moorthy, and Alan Conrad Bovik. The data sets may be downloaded at [datasets.zip - Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10-ZuuEosZlnq6aIlbR__qoogUOJfznDF/view?usp=sharing).

To train a single DnCNN model for pepper noise denoising with unknown probability `p`, the range of `p` was set to [0, 1]. The depth of the DnCNN was set to 30, giving the DnCNN a receptive field of 61 × 61. The weights of the DnCNN were initialized by the method in "Delving Deep into Rectifiers: Surpassing Human-Level Performance on ImageNet Classification" by Kaiming He, Xiangyu Zhang, Shaoqing Ren, and Jian Sun. The optimizer was set to RMSprop with the learning rate 1×10^-2, the momentum factor 0, the smoothing constant 0.99, the numerical stability term 1×10^-8, and the weight decay 0. The batch size was set to 128. The epochs were set to 1000. The models may be downloaded at [models.zip - Google Drive]().

For any sample in any minibatch, the sample was a noisy-residual training image patch pair `(y, v)`. All noisy-residual training image patch pairs `(y, v)` were created by selecting a clean image `x` from the training data set, cropping the clean image `x` at a random location to the size 70 × 70 to create a clean image patch `z`, creating a residual image patch `v` of size 70 × 70, then "adding" the residual image patch `v` to the clean image patch `z` to create a noisy observation patch `y`.

A noisy observation `y` was created by "adding" pepper noise `v` with probability `p = 0.0625` to an image from validation data set. After 957 epochs, the DnCNN denoised the noisy observation `y` as such:

After 16 epochs, the DnCNN denoised the image from [vU4m6.png (2544×3279)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/vU4m6.png) as such:
